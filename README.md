# tie_project
A project on Full Stack Web Development. The task assigned is to design a template for online yoga training centre.

The practice of Yoga is believed to have started with the very dawn of civilization. The
science of yoga originated thousands of years ago, long before religions or belief systems
were born. It works on oneâ€™s body, mind, emotions, and energy. Yoga classes have been
around for a long time, as it is a form of fitness that helps an individual maintain balance,
strength, and flexibility, among other benefits. During the covid era, people opted for online
classes to keep up with their fitness goals. Since then, the trend of online training classes is
only increasing as it allows individuals to stay fit in the comfort of their homes.

I created a website template aimed at facilitating online yoga training. The website contains a
home page, a signup/login page, and a booking page that allow users to book a private/group
class with their favourite instructors, along with many others. The template was created using
various languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django to heighten the website's user
experience.
